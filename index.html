            <h5>Filter FaceOff | Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute</h5>
            <p class="font-serif" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">an embedded Instagram selfie-and-filters-based game that implicitly motivates players towards creative self-expression while making use of the group dynamic between friends to persuade people to be more open while playing the game.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-serif">Our primary persuasive goal was to address this by shifting the motivation behind filter and selfie use from negative reasons like adherence to a beauty standard to more positive reasons like creativity and open self-expression. The embedded design techniques we used to inform our overall persuasive strategy were Intermixing and Obfuscation through Misdirection. To encourage users to take creative selfies, we also employed the idea of Social Proof by making it a multiplayer game to be played by a group of friends.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All the players will be given the same prompt and limited time to quickly take selfies and apply filters, before sharing their selfies directly to an Instagram group chat with participating friends. Once shared, everyone can vote on the best selfie by liking it in the group. The person with the most likes would win the round and get a point. At the end, the winner of the round could earn bonus points by sharing their winning selfie on their Instagram story.</p>
